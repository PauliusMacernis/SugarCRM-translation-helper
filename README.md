# SugarCRM-translation-helper
Developed this tool back in about **2013**. It is basicaly the GUI for making translation files for SugarCRM. Not all features were implemented, but still quite some work has been done.

- Put files inside the root directory of SugarCRM
- Edit `/SugarTranslations/Configuration/Configuration.php ` and enter your own credentials.
- Run the file `SugarTranslations.php` to get the idea on what is this project about...

Tested with: Apache 2.2.22, PHP 5.3.13, MySQL 5.5.24.
